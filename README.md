- The data and the codes have restricted public access as they contain Personally Identifiable Information. Per the confidential agreement I signed with the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research, I cannot share them in the GitHub repository (either public or private, as the data is in a virtual environment without internet access). This study will not provide any replication data.

- However, to facilitate the replication of the study, I have provided the following information:

- 1. fake_data.csv: Fake data to be used in replication codes. The data is generated using the Python codes available in generate_fake.ipynb.

- 2. analysis_fake.Rmd: R Markdown file to replicate the analysis using the fake data.
